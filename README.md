# Every-color-in

This is a small project I've done in some spare time since I was fascinated by the funny and interesting way to show the colors present in a book. I hope it will help you percieve how beautiful data can be.

every-color-in lets you try to achieve a similiar result with any text of your choice.

## Try it
To try it out: download all the files and open 'index.html' .
In the future I may deploy it for a live demo.
